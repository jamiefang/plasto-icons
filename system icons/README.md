The design system provides built-in icons that represent common tasks and types of content in a variety of use cases.

The standard size for system icons is 16px × 16px.

### Keep system icons as few as possible
The design system does not intend to provide a icon for every use case. Instead, it's meant to provide icons that have a specific, well-known meaning and are essential for common tasks.


### Allow developers to bring their own icons
The design system is meant to be used in as many use cases as possible. Different users will need different products. It’s better to allow developers to use their own icons than to misuse a system-provided icon.
